"""
Unit Tests for SpeechService and Natural Speech Integration
============================================================

Tests all required Grade 1 speech, pronunciation, buffer, and mode integration cases:
1. Individual character feedback for A, B, C, and Z.
2. Correct letter-name pronunciation mapping.
3. Decoding the sequence CAT.
4. Reading CAT as one complete word.
5. Reading WHAT IS A CAT? as one complete sentence.
6. Speaking digits 0–9.
7. Speaking plus, minus, multiplication, and division in their correct contexts.
8. Announcing periods, commas, question marks, and exclamation marks.
9. Evaluating 2 + 3, 7 - 2, 3 * 4, and 8 / 2 correctly.
10. Handling division with a non-integer result without silent truncation.
11. Separating Braille control indicators from spoken text where appropriate.
12. Playing a scanner-recognized sentence as complete text.
13. Sending Ollama responses through sentence-level synthesis.
14. Falling back to eSpeak NG when Piper is unavailable.
15. Preventing speech overlap or repeated whole-sentence announcements during character entry.
16. Preserving the existing camera, display, input, math, and AI functionality.
